# CLAUDE.md — Granvia Security Guard Management Platform

> Read this file first in every session. Use it to locate relevant files quickly without broad codebase scanning.

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Granvia** is a security guard workforce management platform with three distinct portals in a single React SPA:

| Portal | Path | Role | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| Admin Panel | `/admin` | `super_admin` | Manage guards, employers, jobs, attendance, reports |
| Guard App | `/guard` | `guard` | Mobile-first: find jobs, mark attendance, manage profile |
| Employer Portal | `/employer` | `employer` | Post jobs, hire guards, manage payments/companies |

The landing page (`/`) lets users choose a portal. Role is stored in the `profiles` table and checked via `useAuth` hook.

---

## 2. Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript (Vite) |
| Routing | Path-based manual routing in `App.tsx` (no `react-router-dom` `<Routes>`) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v3 |
| Animation | Framer Motion |
| Icons | Lucide React |
| Backend/DB | Supabase (Auth + Postgres + Storage) |
| Build | Vite 5 |
| Deploy | Netlify (`netlify.toml` present) |

## 4. Supabase Architecture

**Client file:** `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`
- Exports `supabase` (persistent session) and `createEphemeralSupabaseClient()` (no session persistence — used for isolated operations)

**Auth usage:**
- `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` / `signUp` / `signOut`
- `onAuthStateChange` listener in `AuthContext.tsx`
- Profile auto-created on first login via `buildProfilePayload` → upsert to `profiles`
- Role stored in `profiles.role` (string enum) and optionally `profiles.role_id` (UUID FK to `roles` table)

**Supabase tables detected:**

| Table | Used by |
|-------|---------|
| `profiles` | authService, profileService, AuthContext, adminEmployerService |
| `roles` | roleService |
| `employer_profiles` | profileService, aadhaarVerificationService, adminEmployerService |
| `employer_companies` | companyService, adminEmployerService |
| `employer_aadhaar_verifications` | aadhaarVerificationService |
| `company_sites` | siteService, jobService, adminEmployerService |
| `company_documents` | adminEmployerService |
| `job_posts` | jobService, applicationService, reportService, adminEmployerService |
| `job_applications` | applicationService, adminEmployerService |
| `application_status_logs` | adminEmployerService |
| `interview_requests` | adminEmployerService |
| `job_offers` | adminEmployerService |
| `agreements` | adminEmployerService |
| `attendance_records` | attendanceService, reportService, adminEmployerService |
| `payments` | paymentService, reportService, adminEmployerService |
| `invoices` | paymentService, adminEmployerService |
| `employer_wallets` | walletService, adminEmployerService |
| `wallet_transactions` | walletService, adminEmployerService |
| `notifications` | notificationService |
| `support_tickets` | supportService |
| `support_ticket_messages` | supportService |

**Supabase Storage buckets:**

| Bucket | Used for |
|--------|---------|
| `company-logos` | Employer company logos |
| `company-documents` | KYC/company docs |
| `guard-documents` | Guard identity/police docs |
| `profile-images` | User avatars |
| `invoices` | Invoice PDFs |
| `agreements` | Agreement documents |

All storage via `src/services/storageService.ts` — upload, signed URL, public URL.

**RPC/Edge functions:** None detected in frontend code.

**Realtime:** Not detected in frontend code.

**Environment variable names (no values):**

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

## 7. Business Process Flow

```
1. LANDING       User visits / → selects portal (Admin / Guard / Employer)

2. AUTH          Each portal has its own login screen
                 → Supabase signInWithPassword
                 → AuthContext fetches profile from `profiles`
                 → Role checked: super_admin | guard | employer

3. GUARD FLOW
   Login → MobileDashboard
   → Search jobs (job_posts) → Apply (job_applications)
   → Mark attendance (attendance_records)
   → View profile / upload docs

4. EMPLOYER FLOW
   Signup/Login (email confirm) → EmployerApp
   → Create company (employer_companies) → Add sites (company_sites)
   → Post jobs (job_posts) → Review applicants (job_applications)
   → Aadhaar KYC (employer_aadhaar_verifications) → Manage payments/wallet

5. ADMIN FLOW
   Login → AdminApp (Dashboard)
   → View metrics (reports)
   → Manage guards (profiles)
   → Manage employers (adminEmployerService: full lifecycle)
   → Approve/reject applications, view attendance, wallet/payments
```

> Note: `EmployerApp.tsx` has dual-layer data: some views read from Supabase via services, others still use the legacy `src/lib/storage.ts` local-storage layer. This is a migration in progress.

## 8. Common Commands

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start dev server (Vite, default port 5174 per .env.example)
npm run build        # Production build → dist/
npm run preview      # Serve dist/ locally
npm run lint         # ESLint check
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript compile check (no emit)
```

---

## 9. Low-Token Claude Working Rules

- Always read `CLAUDE.md` first in every session.
- Identify the minimum relevant files before opening anything. Target 3–8 files per task.
- Use Grep/Glob to locate symbols before opening files.
- Ask before scanning more than 15 files.
- For UI-only tasks, skip Supabase service files unless the data shape is unclear.
- For data tasks, read: `supabaseClient.ts` → relevant `services/*.ts` → consuming component.
- Never read: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.git/`, `vite-dev.log`, `vite-node.log`, or generated files.
- Never read or expose values from `.env` or `.env.local`.
- `.env.example` is safe to read.

## 10. Task Routing Guide

| Task type | Start with these files |
|-----------|----------------------|
| UI layout / styling | Relevant `web-admin/pages/*.tsx` or `mobile-guard/screens/*.tsx` |
| Data not loading | Component → `services/<domain>Service.ts` → check Supabase table name |
| Auth / login issue | `AuthContext.tsx`, `authService.ts`, `hooks/useAuth.ts`, portal LoginScreen |
| Database insert/update | `services/<domain>Service.ts` → `supabase/migrations/` for schema |
| Role/permission error | `AuthContext.tsx`, `components/auth/RoleGuard.tsx`, `supabase/migrations/*.sql` (RLS) |
| Storage / file upload | `services/storageService.ts`, bucket name from `UploadTarget` type |
| Employer management | `web-admin/pages/EmployerManagement.tsx` + `services/adminEmployerService.ts` |
| Guard mobile screen | `mobile-guard/screens/<Screen>.tsx` + relevant service |
| Employer portal | `employer/EmployerApp.tsx` + `employer/EmployerAuth.tsx` |
| Reports / metrics | `web-admin/pages/Dashboard.tsx` + `services/reportService.ts` |
| Build / deploy error | `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `netlify.toml`, `.env.example` |
| Aadhaar KYC | `services/aadhaarVerificationService.ts`, `lib/aadhaarService.ts`, `components/auth/AadhaarGate.tsx` |
| Notifications | `services/notificationService.ts` |
| Support tickets | `services/supportService.ts` |

---

## 11. Known Live DB vs Migration Divergences

The live Supabase DB (`uiyllxfhmubtasczqmuj`) has drifted from the migration files. Always verify against the live schema before trusting migrations.

| Item | Migration says | Live DB reality |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| `company_sites.company_id` FK | `references employer_companies(id)` | Was pointing to `companies` table (fixed) |
| `company_sites.name` | NOT NULL | Made nullable (fixed) |
| `job_applications.site_id` | NOT NULL | Made nullable (fixed) |
| `job_posts.latitude/longitude` | Columns exist | Do NOT exist in live DB |
| `is_super_admin()` function | Defined in migration | Not deployed to live DB |
| `is_employer_aadhaar_verified()` function | Defined in migration | Not deployed to live DB |
| `employer_aadhaar_verifications` table | Defined in migration | May not exist in live DB |

**Rule:** When a `PGRST204` (column not found) or `42883` (function not found) error appears, the live DB is missing something from migrations. Fix the service code first; add a migration second. Never assume the live schema matches the files.

---

## 12. Service Layer Rules (Permanent)

- **`siteService.ts`:** Always send both `name` and `site_name` on insert — live DB has `name` column from original schema.
- **`jobService.ts`:** Do NOT send `latitude`/`longitude` — columns do not exist in live `job_posts` table.
- **`aadhaarVerificationService.ts`:** DB inserts are best-effort (non-fatal). Email is via Supabase Edge Function `send-email`. The `_devOtpFallback` in-memory variable is the fallback when the table is missing.
- **`adminEmployerService.ts`:** Uses an ephemeral Supabase client for `signUp` to avoid polluting the admin session. Always throw on auth errors before proceeding to profile/company inserts.
- **`applicationService.ts`:** Validate `company_id` and `site_id` are non-null on the job before inserting an application — `job_applications` has FK constraints on both.

---

## 13. Edge Functions

**Function:** `send-email` (`supabase/functions/send-email/index.ts`)
- Uses `denomailer` (pure Deno SMTP) — **not** `nodemailer` (npm: import crashes Deno)
- Requires signed-in user (checks `Authorization` header)
- SMTP config via Supabase secrets: `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL`, `SMTP_FROM_NAME`
- Deploy: `npx supabase functions deploy send-email --project-ref uiyllxfhmubtasczqmuj`

---

## 14. RLS Policy Rules

- `is_super_admin()` and `is_employer_aadhaar_verified()` DB functions are NOT deployed to live DB.
- All policies must use inline checks: `exists (select 1 from public.profiles where id = auth.uid() and role = 'super_admin')`
- Never write RLS policies that call these functions until they are confirmed deployed.
- See `supabase/migrations/202606090001_relax_aadhaar_write_policies.sql` for the correct pattern.

---

## 15. Employer Portal Architecture Note

The `/employer` portal (`src/employer/EmployerApp.tsx`) has **two Aadhaar verification entry points**:

1. `AadhaarGate` component (`src/components/auth/AadhaarGate.tsx`) → renders `AadhaarVerificationSlider` — used as a route wrapper
2. `AadhaarVerificationPage` function inside `EmployerApp.tsx` — the actual page at `page === 'aadhaar'`

When fixing Aadhaar OTP display bugs, **both components must be updated**. The main employer flow uses #2, not #1.

**Key state bug pattern to avoid:** `AadhaarVerificationPage` receives `key={refresh}` from parent. Calling `onChanged()` inside `sendOtp()` triggers a re-mount and wipes all local state. Only call `onChanged()` after successful OTP verification, not after sending.

---

## 16. Unknowns / Needs Confirmation

- **`employer/EmployerApp.tsx` data layer:** Mixes Supabase services and legacy `src/lib/storage.ts`. Confirm which features are fully migrated.
- **Realtime subscriptions:** None in frontend — confirm if needed.
- **Payment gateway:** `VITE_PAYMENT_GATEWAY_PUBLIC_KEY` present but no SDK in dependencies — confirm gateway.
- **Aadhaar API:** `lib/aadhaarService.ts` may call an external API — not fully audited.
- **`roles` table:** Must contain rows for `super_admin`, `employer`, `guard` — `profiles.role_id` FK depends on this.

---

## 17. Map System Architecture

### Provider Abstraction (IMPORTANT — read before touching any map code)

Maps are implemented through a **two-level abstraction** so Leaflet can be swapped for Google Maps by changing one env var.

```
VITE_MAP_PROVIDER=leaflet   ← current default (no API key needed)
VITE_MAP_PROVIDER=google    ← future (requires VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY + Google provider impl)
```

**Files:**

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/components/map/types.ts` | Shared TS types: `LatLng`, `MapMarker`, `MapViewProps`, `LocationPickerProps` |
| `src/components/map/MapView.tsx` | **Provider switch** — reads `VITE_MAP_PROVIDER`, renders correct impl |
| `src/components/map/LocationPicker.tsx` | **Provider switch** for click-to-pin picker |
| `src/components/map/leaflet/LeafletMapView.tsx` | Leaflet impl of `MapViewProps` |
| `src/components/map/leaflet/LeafletLocationPicker.tsx` | Leaflet impl of `LocationPickerProps` |
| `src/components/map/index.ts` | Barrel export |
| `src/lib/geoUtils.ts` | `distanceKm()` (haversine) + `getCurrentPosition()` (browser geolocation) |

**Per-role map components** (consume `MapView` / `LocationPicker` — never Leaflet directly):

| File | Used by | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `src/components/map/JobRadiusMap.tsx` | Guard `JobSearch.tsx` | Jobs as pins + guard radius circle + geolocation |
| `src/components/map/AdminOverviewMap.tsx` | Admin `Dashboard.tsx` | Guards (green) + Sites (red) + Jobs (blue) overview |
| `LocationPicker` (inline) | Employer `EmployerApp.tsx` site form | Click map → sets `form.latitude` / `form.longitude` |

### Switching to Google Maps later

1. Create `src/components/map/google/GoogleMapView.tsx` implementing `MapViewProps`
2. Create `src/components/map/google/GoogleLocationPicker.tsx` implementing `LocationPickerProps`
3. In `MapView.tsx` and `LocationPicker.tsx`, uncomment the `google` branch (marked with `// future`)
4. Set `VITE_MAP_PROVIDER=google` in `.env`
5. Remove Leaflet CSS import from `src/main.tsx`
6. **Zero changes needed** in any consumer component (`JobRadiusMap`, `AdminOverviewMap`, site form)

### Marker colour convention
- **Blue `#1d4ed8`** — Jobs
- **Green `#166534`** — Guards
- **Red `#7c2d12`** — Sites
- **Purple `#5b21b6`** — Employers

### Coordinates availability
- `company_sites`: `latitude`, `longitude` columns exist in live DB
- `job_posts`: lat/lng do **NOT** exist in live DB — coordinates come from the joined `company_sites`
- `profiles` (guards): lat/lng defined in migrations but not confirmed in live DB
- `attendance_records`: `checkin_latitude/longitude`, `checkout_latitude/longitude` for geofencing

## 18. Core Requirements from Project Timeline

The project is scoped across 3 phases (12–15 weeks total). Use this as the authoritative feature checklist.

### Phase 1 — Core Platform & Job Marketplace (4–5 Weeks)
| Feature | Status in code |
|---------|---------------|
| User Registration/Login (Guard & Employer) | Implemented |
| Profile Creation (Guard + Employer) | Implemented |
| Document Upload (ID, Police Verification, Bank Details) | Implemented (`storageService.ts`) |
| Aadhaar API Integration (client-provided API) | Implemented (`aadhaarService.ts`) |
| **Google Maps Integration — Location & Radius-based job search** | API key present (`VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`), **implementation missing** |
| Employer: Create Company / Site | Implemented |
| Employer: Post Job | Implemented |
| Guard: Search Job (radius-based via Maps) | UI exists (`JobSearch.tsx`), radius filtering **not implemented** |
| Guard: Apply for Job | Implemented |

**Google Maps requirement:** Job search must filter by geographic radius. Guard sets location; jobs within radius are shown on map. Requires `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` and a Maps SDK (`@vis.gl/react-google-maps` or `@react-google-maps/api`).

---

### Phase 2 — Hiring, Attendance & Payment (5–6 Weeks)
| Feature | Status in code |
|---------|---------------|
| Employer: View Applicants / Select / Reject | Partially implemented (`applicationService.ts`) |
| **Request Call / Video Interaction (Guard ↔ Employer)** | **Not implemented** — no service or UI found |
| Guard: Accept Job offer | Partially implemented |
| Attendance: In-Time / Out-Time Logging | Implemented (`attendanceService.ts`) |
| **Employer Verification step in hiring workflow** | Unclear — not documented |
| **Agreement Module: Digital onboarding / confirmation** | `agreements` table exists; UI/flow **not documented** |
| Wallet System (Coin-based) | `walletService.ts` exists; coin denomination logic **not documented** |
| Payment Gateway Integration | Key present (`VITE_PAYMENT_GATEWAY_PUBLIC_KEY`); SDK not found |
| **Payment Flow: Employer → Platform → Manpower** | Not implemented end-to-end |
| **OTP Confirmation for Cash Payment** | **Not implemented** |

**Payment flow requirement:** Employer funds wallet → platform holds → releases to guard after job confirmation. Cash payments require OTP confirmation from guard side.

---

### Phase 3 — Admin, Reports & Deployment (3–4 Weeks)
| Feature | Status in code |
|---------|---------------|
| Admin Panel | Implemented (`web-admin/`) |
| **Sub Admin Panel** | **Not implemented** — no sub-admin role, UI, or service found |
| **Block / Unblock Users** | **Not implemented** — no flag on `profiles` table |
| Dashboard: Real-time stats (Jobs, Guards, Revenue) | Basic stats in `Dashboard.tsx`; real-time **not implemented** |
| Reports: Area-wise availability | **Not implemented** |
| Reports: Language Skills | **Not implemented** |
| Reports: Commission Tracking | **Not implemented** |
| Reports: Manpower Availability | **Not implemented** |
| Reports: Earnings | Partial (`reportService.ts`) |

**Sub Admin role:** Needs a new role (`sub_admin`) with scoped permissions — can manage company staff and sites but not platform-wide settings. Requires new RLS policies and a portal entry point.

**Block/Unblock Users:** Needs a `is_blocked` boolean on `profiles` + admin UI action + auth check on login to reject blocked users.
